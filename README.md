## Original Purpose

Originally, I created the first version of the 3D Mango Hero because I felt that it would be needed for the future of the project and its future in the "metaverse." Most people in the NFT space were talking about how 3D looking NFTs were taking over and projects started following the Degen Ape Academy art style.

## Development

Over time, I developed and worked on better models and models for other variations of mangos as the 3D concept of the Ziyou game was under development.

## Open Sourcing

With the decision to make Ziyou into a 2D game rather than a 3D game, I thought the best use of these models was to open them up to the community.
They can be converted to vtubers with a little work in blender and unity. I've enclosed the texture maps, .fbx files, and will add relevant .blend files shortly.

Check out https://vrm.dev/ if you are looking to make a tuber as well as YouTube for relevant tutorials.
